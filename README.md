# retro-pixel-blog

Create a minimalist blog site in the style of pixel games using Flask. Use retro-style pixel art in the user interface to create a simple and attractive look. On the homepage of the site, have a pixel game scene. The scene should look like a retro-style pixel map with various pixel objects on it. One of these objects represents blog posts. Users can access the relevant posts by clicking on these objects. Clicking on the title of each post will take you to a pixel-designed post display screen. This screen should look like a retro-style game menu and contain options that allow users to read the article. Use a pixel-style form for adding and editing posts. This form should look like a menu inside a pixel-style game. A retro style text editor is preferable when entering or editing your text. Also, provide an interface where you can easily create new posts by adding an additional page for writing. However, unnecessary features such as user registration and login should be avoided, and a system where only you can share your posts should be created.
